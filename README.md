# 📊 **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**

---

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project!** 🚀  
This repository showcases a complete **data warehousing and analytics solution** — from building a robust data warehouse to creating **actionable business insights**.  
It’s designed as a portfolio project to highlight **modern best practices** in **Data Engineering**, **ETL**, and **Analytics**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** pattern with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer:**  
   Raw data storage — ingests CSV files into a **SQL Server Database** as-is.

2. **Silver Layer:**  
   Cleansing, standardizing, and transforming raw data into clean, reliable data sets ready for modeling.

3. **Gold Layer:**  
   Business-ready data modeled in a **Star Schema** optimized for reporting, analytics, and BI dashboards.

## 📖 Project Scope

**Key Components:**

1. 🗂️ **Data Architecture:**  
   Modern **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

2. ⚙️ **ETL Pipelines:**  
   End-to-end extraction, transformation, and loading from source CSV files to the final warehouse.

3. 🧩 **Data Modeling:**  
   Well-designed **fact** and **dimension tables** for performant analytical queries.

4. 📈 **Analytics & Reporting:**  
   Insightful **SQL-based reports** and dashboards delivering **Customer Behavior**, **Product Performance**, and **Sales Trends**.
